In this project, the web service mines data from the Skyscanner Flight Search API (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search/) and return the desired results. The user will input the desired airports through a web form and the web service will present the 5 cheapest options in EUR currency, as well as their overall duration and the operating carriers' ID.

For the purposes of the above web service, I will use Angular JS, Webstorm, Node.js and Postman.
