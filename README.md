# Pharmaceutical-Clinical-Trials

# General
In this project, the web service mines data from the Skyscanner Flight Search API (https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search/) and return the desired results. The user will input the desired airports through a web form and the web service will present the 5 cheapest options in EUR currency, as well as their overall duration and the operating carriers' ID.

For the purposes of the above web service, I will use Angular JS, Webstorm, Node.js and Postman.

# Installation
1) Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Download the application code from the GitHub Repository and save it to the desired folder in your PC.
3) Install Angular by running the following command in CLI: npm install -g @angular/cli
4) Find the directory path of the folder in which you have saved the application code and change your working directory there by the cd command in CLI.
   e.g C:\Users\John\Desktop\Internet-Applications-Project\Pharmaceutical-Clinical-Trials\angular\Pharmaceutical-Clinical-Trials
5) Run the application by executing the ng serve command in CLI. A browser window will automatically open in port 4200 of localhost, where you will find the Starting page of the application.
